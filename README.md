# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

In this project I created an entire API to serve information to a fictional Boss Machine. I created the routes and other middleware functions to allow the API to function. The areas of this project I built were the server.js file and the server folder in the projcet directory. This project was supplied by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) to illustrate my knowledge of the Expressjs framework.

1. Run `npm install` to download the required dependencies
